this is a godot game which the hero is a magical creature needs to find his origin and his parents so he is in an adventure to find them
the game is a simple platformer and it is the first game that i made. also the assets is from itch io and the animations is also from itch io.
i made the tiles to be like a cave or underground maze and i think i will finish it in the next week.
i made it because of my inspiration for hollow knight.
